                <section id="history-section">
                    <p>Vanguard Airlines began with a simple mission to make premium air travel accessible to more people across the globe. We started with just three aircraft and a handful of dedicated routes between major coastal cities. Over the years, our operation expanded because we stayed true to our core values of safety and transparency. We have carefully grown our team to include the most experienced pilots and service professionals in the industry. Every milestone we reach is a result of the trust that our passengers place in us every single day. Our history is not just about the planes we fly but the connections we help people make across borders. We continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our future is even brighter than our past. This journey has taught us that a great airline is built on a foundation of respect for the traveler.</p>
